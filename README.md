### Hi!
This is an itty bitty scrap of code that makes playlist (.m3u) files based on a standard file structure. Just drop the main.py file into a folder, create a folder called "Playlists", and put all of your playlists into "Playlists" folder. Each playlist must be it's own folder and all the songs must be .mp3.

There is no way this will be useful to anybody, but if it is, great!
